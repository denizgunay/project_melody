# Melody Generator 🎶

This project is a Melody Generator designed to produce musical sequences using mathematical representations. The goal is to create melodies that can be used as a base for composing music or further analysis.

## Project Status 🚧
Currently, the project generates mathematical representations of melodies, but these representations **have not yet been converted to musical notes**. As such, this project is still in development and not fully functional as a melody generator.

## How It Works 🔍
The model is trained on a dataset of musical patterns and generates outputs that are currently represented as mathematical or symbolic data. The final goal is to translate these outputs into actual musical notes, but this feature is still a work in progress.

## Key Features ✨
- **Melody Generation**: Generates melody-like sequences based on input patterns.
- **Mathematical Representations**: Outputs sequences in mathematical form.
